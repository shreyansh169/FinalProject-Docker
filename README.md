# Docker_Project under IIEC RISE 1.0

Hey there ! In this quarantine time under **IIEC-RISE 1.0** campaign I learnt about Docker and made project using Docker to set-up a WebApp called **Joomla**.

All thanks to Vimal Daga Sir, Indeed explored many new things.. was great learning experience overall.

Project Summary :
+ Launched Joomla using docker-compose

+ used mysql : 5.7 as database server

+ Joomla is a free and open-source content management system for publishing web content, developed by Open Source Matters, Inc. It is built on a model–view–controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS.
